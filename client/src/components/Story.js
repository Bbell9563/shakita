              Hello! My name is Dusty LaDawn Bailey and I am the Owner of Shakti LLC. I guess we should begin with
              the question of why use the name Shakti??? Great question! Shakti has a long history and a powerful
              meaning. The basics being: Shakti means POWER in Sanskrit and in Hinduism a Shakti is the female
              counterpart of a God. Shakti relates to divine energy. In the practice of Yoga, Shakti centers on the Sun
              Salutations. The work is done with your inner energy, power for your poses and your breathing exercises. To me, this one word holds so much truth. It solidifies your internal power. It builds up your poses and it
              allows you to have access to the pure power of your breathing. I could not imagine a more appropriate
              word that brings forth what is inside of you and what your heart and soul belong to.

              I have spent 21 years of my life in a fast paced and a fairly financially stable profession. While it was a
              satisfying position, a powerful position, it never provided me real truth and real purpose. It did not allow
              me to develop a power that brought about peace, healing and growth. What does power do for you or
              anyone around you if that power is not used as a tool to develop yourself? Real power allows for personal
              and spiritual growth. It is not about what you do, how much money you make, or who you get to boss
              around. It is internal recognition of self and genuine energy.

              In July of 2018 I was devestated to learn that I have Multiple Sclerosis. A diagnosis like this can quickly
              take away that power. It can replace it with fear and uncertainty. It then becomes a constant nagging
              question “ what does my future look like now”. So, I spent some time wallowing in self pity. Feeling sorry
              for myself and allowing myself to lose hope at every opportunity. It consumed me. It broke me in every
              way possible. Then in January 2019, I decided to take steps of moving past a developed desperate life framework that
              only carried fear and held on tightly to my internal being. I began working as a Physical Therapy Aide. I
              worked with all different types of Patients for all different types of reasons and found that the common
              denominator was they did not allow themselves to be swept away by fear. They did not allow fear and
              negative dreams to takeover that could haunt during the day and night. I wanted that, I wanted to let go of
              my fear. Making this decision brought back my self awareness. It brought back my confidence and trust in
              my capabilities.

              So, in January of 2020, I had a thoughtful and enlighting conversation with myself. For the first time in
              what could be forever, I allowed myself a moment to believe that all things are possible. To allow for the
              possibility that setbacks were stepping stones to self love and self compassion. I asked myself all the
              important question. The questions that we rarely have the opportunity to ask ourselves. “What do I want?”. “What do I believe in?”. Then the most important question of all- “ If I could do anything, be a part of
              anything, what would that anything be?”. I knew the answers before I even finished the questions. I want
              to respect my health situation but not allow it to rule my soul. I want to not only take my life back but I
              want to spend the rest of my days helping others do the same. Healthy or not healthy. Happy or
              dissatisfied. Hopeful or hopeless. It did not matter the state everyone else because I embodied all of those
              thoughts and emotions at one time or another. The next day I found a wonderful Yoga Instructors class that fit me in right away. Our goals were aligned
              and I felt peace during every class and every conversation filled my heart with passion. I graduated, Certified and became a Yoga Instructor. I now offered this spiritual place for any soul that needed
              enlightning and a place to feel cared for. This was the moment that one word lifted me up to the point I thought I would never come down... Shakti. My Power. I took off running in a new direction of self empowerment. I applied for a license and began my
              soul searching for other skills I beleive I held. Those skills were now my service to others and as a default
              side effect, those same skills were my service to me.

              I wanted to take my service to others a step further. I wanted to offer people options in my quest to ease
              worried minds. Not only did I now possess a skill to ease some souls but I wanted to make people feel
              beautiful inside and out. I decided that I woluld become a Permanent Makeup Artist. We all feel better on
              the inside when we look good on the outside. It is one of those superficial glorious traits we learn over the
              years and it works. I will be graduating next week and I will become a Permanent Makeup Artist. These goals that I had set for myself were accomplished because I no longer lived to have MS. I lived to
              respect MS. I chose to emotionally carry my MS with me as a reminder that strength can truly come from
              nothing.

              I am proud of where I am, what I have done, and for deciding I want to be in a life of service. To myself
              and others. That is where the power is. It is not in selfishness or ingnorance of others. It is in our
              recognition of others. It is our commitment to ourselves and others that holds the power and it is in our
              service to others that keeps us powerful. It is in making the choice to welcome change and learn to move
              within that change rather than fight it with the little energy we have.

              Shakti is my souls promise to take care of me and take care of everyone that I have the opportunity to. Shakti is my accomplishments that I persevered through, the failures that I learned to accept as a lesson
              and the grounding of my soul to yours.

              We all have our own Shakti. Carry it with you always and be proud of who you are. Remind yourself daily
              that someone needs your kindness and a genuine soul. Repeat the acts that you have previously done
              that have brought a moment of happiness to someone else. Stand in your power that reminds you that
              you are who you are and only you know how to use your Shakti.
